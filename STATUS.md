- ✅ Create GitHub issues from blueprint (133 issues: 10 epics, 34 features, 89 tasks)
- ✅ **Star Atlas API Research Spike Complete** (Issue #141)
  - ADR-001: Hybrid data sourcing strategy (Galaxy API + Solana RPC)
  - Data inventory: 10+ data types cataloged with TypeScript interfaces
  - Cost analysis: 91% reduction ($45/month → $4/month)
  - Implementation plan: 4 phases over 2 weeks
- ✅ **Star Atlas Deep Research Phase Complete** (2025-11-13)
  - z.ink Integration: Dec 2025 launch, zProfile eliminates transaction friction
  - Unreal Engine/F-Kit: SAGE AI competitor identified, 1,590 txs/day friction quantified
  - Governance: DAO structure analyzed, Ecosystem Fund grant opportunity ($2.5k-$7.5k)
  - Tokenomics: ATLAS/POLIS/SOL economics documented, $1.37M annual DAO accrual
  - Competitors: ATOM & SLY analysis, market gap identified (no AI/voice/optimization)
  - EvEye Deep Dive: Comprehensive data platform, no public API, self-hosted wins (99.3% cheaper)
  - Historical Backfill Analysis: Live collection wins ($24 vs $124), 6 months sufficient for MVP
  - RPC Provider Analysis: Helius Developer tier selected ($49/month), 19 Star Atlas programs cataloged
  - Star Frame Analysis: Critical for Phase 2+ (on-chain agent NFT ownership, dynamic memory)
  - Portable Agent Architecture: NFT-based ownership model, users own personality (sell/transfer)

**In Progress:**
- 🔍 Investigating previous work after IDE crash
- Determining next development phase (Memory Service, Agent Core, or MCP Server)

**Recently Completed (2025-11-13):**
- ✅ Epic #1 - Foundation & Infrastructure (Issues #1-15)
  - Terraform AWS infrastructure
  - CI/CD pipeline with 5 workflows
  - Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- ✅ Epic #2 - Authentication System (Issues #16-24)
  - Email magic link authentication
  - Wallet signature challenge
  - User profile management (DynamoDB)
  - JWT utilities and auth middleware
- ✅ Web app wallet connection components (partial)

**Next Up:**
- [ ] Add test coverage for auth-service
- [ ] Choose next epic: Memory Service, Agent Core, or MCP Server
- [ ] Continue web-app frontend development

## Known Issues

### Critical
None

### High Priority
**Workflow Violation**: Recent commits (b347adb, 7c214a8, c90f3b1, a3e16ce, 96cab13) were made directly to `dev` instead of using feature branches and PRs. This violates CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines. All future work must follow the proper workflow:
  1. Branch from dev
  2. Make changes on feature branch
  3. Create PR to dev
  4. Merge after review

### Medium Priority
**Auth Service Issues** (Post-implementation review 2025-11-13):
1. **Missing Tests**: Zero test coverage (no .test.ts or .spec.ts files exist)
2. **Data Model Issue**: Users table uses `email` as primary key, but wallet-only users get placeholder emails (`{wallet}@wallet.local`). This could cause:
   - Collision if real user has that email domain
   - Notification failures (not a real email)
   - **Recommendation**: Migrate to `userId` as primary key
3. **Security Gaps**:
   - No rate limiting on magic link sends (spam/abuse risk)
   - Email normalization inconsistent (lowercase in some places, not others)
   - No input sanitization beyond basic validation
4. **Missing Observability**: Only console.error logging, no structured logging or metrics

### Low Priority
None

## Recent Achievements (Last 2 Weeks)

**Vision & Planning Session** 
- Completed: 2025-11-12
- Established multi-user SaaS scope with voice-first interface
- Defined AWS Free Tier architecture (<$10/month MVP)
- Documented strategic differentiation from EvEye (AI insights vs data viz)
- Extracted wisdom from galactic-data archives (Solana integration patterns)

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Complete Base Documentation**
   - ARCHITECTURE.md with tech stack, database schema, ADRs
   - CONTRIBUTING.md with GitHub workflow
   - DEVELOPMENT.md with git branching, pre-commit checklist
   - CHANGELOG.md with Keep a Changelog format

2. **Generate Project Blueprint**
   - Use `blueprint-planner` subagent to create specs/BLUEPRINT.yaml
   - Validate complexity with `improving-plans` skill
   - Ensure AI-adjusted timeline estimates (20x human speedup)

3. **Set Up GitHub Infrastructure**
   - Create GitHub issues from blueprint
   - Configure project boards
   - Set up branch protection rules (dev � main only)
   - Initialize CI/CD workflows

4. **Begin Implementation**
   - MCP server first (Solana + Star Atlas data access)
   - Agent core (Claude Agent SDK integration)
   - Voice service (WebRTC + Whisper + ElevenLabs)
   - Web app (React + Vite frontend)

## Open Questions

**Resolved during planning:**
1. ~~Architecture pattern?~~ � Serverless + DynamoDB (AWS Free Tier)
2. ~~Price monitoring strategy?~~ � Secondary feature (context for AI, not charting)
3. ~~Target users?~~ � Multi-user SaaS

**Still pending:**
1. **Voice UX**: Push-to-talk vs always-listening? (Recommend PTT for MVP - simpler, lower cost)
2. **Authentication**: Wallet-based (Solana) vs traditional (email)? (Recommend both - wallet for on-chain, email for notifications)
3. **Subscription tiers**: Free tier limits? (Recommend: Free = 5 fleets, Pro = unlimited)
4. **Market data frequency**: How often refresh prices? (Recommend: 5-min like EvEye for MVP)
5. **Alert delivery**: Voice-only vs also push notifications/email? (Recommend: Multi-channel for MVP)

**Decision point**: Resolve during blueprint creation or defer to implementation?
